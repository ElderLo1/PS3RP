# PS3RP
A node.js app that fetches one's PSN status and sets it as their Discord Rich Presence. Intended for use with the PS3 or other legacy consoles, as the PS4 and PS5 have native support for discord rich presence without the use of a tool.

## Depoendencies
You will need the following for this to work properly:
- Node.js
- psn-api (node.js module)
- discord-rich-presence (node.js module)
- A PSN account (obviously)
- A Discord Account and access to the Developer Portal
