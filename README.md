# PS3RP
A node.js app that fetches one's PSN status every minute and sets it as their Discord Rich Presence. Intended for use with the PS3 or other legacy consoles (such as the PS Vita or PSP), as the PS4 and PS5 have native support for discord rich presence without the use of a tool.

## Depoendencies
You will need the following for this to work properly:
- Node.js
- psn-api (node.js module)
- discord-rich-presence (node.js module)
- A PSN account (obviously)
- A Discord Account and access to the Developer Portal

## Is there a tutorial for using this?
Yes! Go to this link: https://github.com/Kobun42/PS3RP/wiki/Getting-Started

## Is this tool 100% safe for my PSN account?
I'd say as long as you don't modify it to spam requests to the PSN servers or something stupid like that, you're safe. but please do take this with a grain of salt. I am not repsonsible for anything that happens to your PSN account by using this.

## How should it look when it's working?
